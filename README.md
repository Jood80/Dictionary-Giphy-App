# Dictionary-Giphy-App

## Our project 
### What
A dictionary app that displays images or gifs related to the word that the user is searching for.
### How
we came up with the idea to create an app that makes it easier for someone to understand the meaning of the the word he's searching for, by displaying related gifs under the translation of the word, and that way it'll be easire for the user to remember the  meaning of words.
### Why 
to make it easier for someone to understand the meaning of the the word he's searching for & to help the user to remember the  meaning of words.
